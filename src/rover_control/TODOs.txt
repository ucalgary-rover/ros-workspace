TODO:
- Move DCMotor to a separate package
- Figure out package names that best suit the rover and put everything in the separate packages
- System standards:
    - all new packages need to use the underscore character
    - subdirectories should use the underscore characters too
    - if possible, namespace implementations should be placed under folders which match their names:
        - EG: 
        namespace Motors:
        should be under a folder motors

        - all lowercase names make it easier to type directories quickly in the terminal and minimize weird stuff
        happening b/c capitalization

- Communicate with Mechanical / MTRON / ZTRON (not sure which) -> what are the specific needs for the science tool DC Motor?
- Camera Backup plan: poll /dev/video* in terminal, run ffplay over serial (is this even possible, and if so, how does it work?)
- Panorama: really not sure how to go about this. Perhaps Derek would know?
